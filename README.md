# ASA 2021 DataFest Modeling Challenge

Analyzed prescription drug misuse in Germany.

Utilized up-sampling by replicating the occurrences of the “minority” variable to balance the dataset. 

Trained the model using a random forest classifier and cross-validated the results to mitigate overfitting.
